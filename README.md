### About This Project

I built this project as a core piece of my portfolio to master the fundamentals of web development. The goal was to go beyond a simple script and create a real, multi-user web application with a secure authentication system, a database, a clean, interactive frontend, and deploy it to a live server.

---

### What Can It Do? âœ¨

* **Secure User Accounts:** Users can register for a new account and log in securely. The app keeps every user's task list completely private.
* **Full Task Management (CRUD):** You can easily **C**reate new tasks, **R**ead your list, **U**pdate tasks (e.g., mark them as complete or edit the title), and **D**elete them.
* **Clean, Modern & Responsive UI:** The interface is styled with Bootstrap 5 and `django-crispy-forms` to be user-friendly and responsive on any device.
* **User Feedback System:** The app provides clear error and success messages using Django's messaging framework.

### My Tech Stack ðŸ’»

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
* **Forms:** `django-crispy-forms`
* **Database:** SQLite3
* **Deployment:** PythonAnywhere
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### What's Next?

I'm proud of how this project turned out, but I'm always thinking about what's next. Some ideas for future improvements include:
* Adding a search/filter functionality for tasks.
* Implementing due dates and priority levels for tasks.
* Using AJAX to update tasks without a full page reload.

Thanks for checking out my project!
